# CDC_Ingestion

This project aims to build a comprehensive end-to-end data pipeline that leverages various data engineering tools to handle real-time data processing. The primary goal is to extract data from a MySQL database using Change Data Capture (CDC) techniques with Debezium, transport this data using Kafka, process it using Apache Spark, and store the final output in a file-based storage system. The project demonstrates a robust approach to ingesting and processing data in real-time, ensuring that database changes are immediately reflected in downstream systems for further processing and analysis
